            <center> <b>What Do We Do</b> is an online platform designed for making difficult conversations simple.<br>
                All you need to do in order to start is just creating a debate and inviting your colleagues to take a part in it.<br>
                Our platform will then determine based on the set of arguments and votes provided by the participants which outcome will be the best.<br><br>
                All of that is possible thanks to <i>Argumentative Decision Making</i> which in conjunction with a specifically designed for this purpose algorithm can provide an unbaiased and rational answer to the question at hand.
